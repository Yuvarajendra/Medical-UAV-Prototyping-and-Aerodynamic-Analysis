# Medical-UAV-Prototyping-and-Aerodynamic-Analysis

Timely medical assistance in remote and rural areas in case of emergencies is a major concern around the world. In many cases, quick delivery of first aid and other
basic medical supplies for self help aids in buying more time for professional medical attention. The most feasible mode of quick supply can be achieved by using drones as it can bypass all types of terrains and connectivity hurdles.

A concept UAV was generated for this purpose which can transport 4 kilograms of payload over a range of 120 kilometers at a cruising speed of 150 kmph. Upon arrival
at the drop-off site, the UAV deploys the payload at a steady descent speed with the help of a parachute and the UAV returns back to the base for the next mission.
