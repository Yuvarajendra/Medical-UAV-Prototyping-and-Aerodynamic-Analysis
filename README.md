# Medical-UAV-Prototyping
Timely medical assistance in remote and rural areas in case of emergencies is a major concern around the world. In many cases, quick delivery of first aid and other
basic medical supplies for self help aids in buying more time for professional medical attention. The most feasible mode of quick supply can be achieved by using drones as it can bypass all types of terrains and connectivity hurdles.

A concept UAV was generated for this purpose which can transport 4 kilograms of payload over a range of 120 kilometers at a cruising speed of 150 kmph. Upon arrival
at the drop-off site, the UAV deploys the payload at a steady descent speed with the help of a parachute and the UAV returns back to the base for the next mission.

A fully functional prototype UAV was previously developed for the purpose of medical payload transport which could carry payloads upto 4 kgs and  fly for more than 100 kms. The UAV was designed with a minimalist approach consisting of a cubical fuselage as it would allow more space utilisation inside the fuselage. The UAV features a rectangular un-swept wing mounted in a high wing configuration. 

The airfoil used for the main wing is NACA 2410, while that for the empennage is NACA 0012. The UAV was propelled with the help of two wing mounted motors with propellers and lastly, a conventional empennage has been chosen to provide yaw and pitch moments.
